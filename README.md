# MSB Article Scanner & Analyzer

This project contains two main Python scripts designed to streamline the process of finding and evaluating recent scientific articles from Molecular Systems Biology (MSB).

1.  **`msb_scanner.py`**: Scans the MSB RSS feed for the latest articles and generates a basic Markdown report containing titles, authors, publication dates, DOIs, and abstracts.
2.  **`article_analyzer.py`**: Takes a Markdown report (like the one generated by `msb_scanner.py`) as input and uses the Grok API (via XAI) to perform an in-depth analysis of each article, outputting the results to a separate, detailed Markdown file.

## Workflow

1.  Run `msb_scanner.py` to fetch the latest articles and create a report (e.g., `reports/msb_articles_YYYYMMDD.md`).
2.  Run `article_analyzer.py`, providing the report generated in step 1 as input, to get a detailed analysis using Grok.

## Script Details

### 1. `msb_scanner.py` (Article Fetcher)

**Features:**

-   Fetches the latest articles from the MSB RSS feed (`https://www.embopress.org/feed/17444292/most-recent`).
-   Extracts article titles, authors, publication dates, DOIs, and abstracts.
-   Generates a simple Markdown report listing the collected information.
-   Saves reports with datestamps (e.g., `reports/msb_articles_YYYYMMDD.md`).

**Usage:**

```bash
python msb_scanner.py [-o <output_file_path>]
```

-   `-o <output_file_path>` or `--output <output_file_path>`: (Optional) Specify the full path (including filename) where the report should be saved. If omitted, it defaults to `reports/msb_articles_YYYYMMDD.md` within the project directory.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Run with default output location (./reports/)
python msb_scanner.py

# Run and save to a custom location
python msb_scanner.py -o "C:/MyScans/MSB/msb_scan_today.md"
```

**Output:**

Creates a Markdown file (either at the default or specified location) with basic article details.

### 2. `article_analyzer.py` (Grok Analysis)

**Features:**

-   Reads article details from a specified Markdown input file (like those generated by `msb_scanner.py`).
-   Connects to the Grok API (`grok-3-beta` model via `api.x.ai/v1`).
-   Sends a detailed prompt for comprehensive analysis.
-   Generates analysis results in Markdown format.
-   Saves the detailed analysis to a new Markdown output file.
-   Supports command-line arguments for input/output files.

**Configuration:**

-   **API Key:** Requires an XAI platform API key.
-   **Environment File:** Create `.env` in `OneDrive/Documents` (`C:/Users/<YourUsername>/OneDrive/Documents/.env`).
-   **Add Key:** Add `XAI_API_KEY=your_actual_xai_api_key_here` to the `.env` file.

**Usage:**

```bash
python article_analyzer.py <input_markdown_file> [-o <output_markdown_file>]
```

-   `<input_markdown_file>`: (Required) Path to the report generated by `msb_scanner.py` (e.g., `reports/msb_articles_20250414.md`).
-   `-o <output_markdown_file>`: (Optional) Path for the analysis output file. Defaults to `[input_filename]_analysis_YYYYMMDD.md` in the same directory as the input.

**Example:**

```bash
# First, run the scanner
python msb_scanner.py

# Then, run the analyzer on the scanner's output
python article_analyzer.py reports/msb_articles_20250414.md -o reports/msb_articles_20250414_analyzed.md
```

**Input Format for Analyzer:**

Expects Markdown files with articles separated by `---`, including `## Title`, `Authors:`, `DOI:`, and `Abstract:` fields.

**Output Format from Analyzer:**

Creates a detailed Markdown file (e.g., `msb_articles_20250414_analyzed.md`) containing the original article info plus the Grok analysis for each article.
